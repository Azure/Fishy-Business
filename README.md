## Instance Segmentation Pipeline - Mask R-CNN, PyTorch

Easily create custom computer vision models to detect and mask objects in your images and video for counting, movement, shape[,](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/) and proportions.

1. Frame Reduction and Proposal - From a video, retain only the frames consisting of the visual content you're interested in, using the [Cognitive Services, Scence and Activity Recognition Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/#analyze).
2. Frame Annotation - Annotate frames from Step 1 using [VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/), [COCO Annotation UI](https://github.com/tylin/coco-ui), [Labelbox](https://labelbox.com/) or another image annotation tool.
3. Visualise Class Distribution - View the accumulation of samples per class
4. Prepare Training Dataset
5. View Training Dataset
6. Model Training
7. Model Scoring
